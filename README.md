# xunoUiBreadcrumbs
Modified "uiBreadcrumbs" from "angularUtils" made by @michaelbromley

## Additional breadcrumbs feature
You can specify a setting `breadcrumb-property` and say in which state property an array of additional breadcrumbs is stored, just like "displayname-property". 
Then you can fill the breadcrumbs array with additional objects which have two keys: displayName (required) and route (optional)
